[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/harshad-number/solutions/4952281/easy-to-understand-2-approaches-beats-java-solution/)

An integer divisible by the sum of its digits is said to be a Harshad number. You are given an integer ``x``. Return *the sum of the digits of x if x is a __Harshad number__, otherwise, return -1*.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** x = 18  <br>
**Output:** 9

**Explanation:**
The sum of digits of x is 9. 18 is divisible by 9. So 18 is a Harshad number and the answer is 9.

**Example 2:** 

**Input:** x = 23 <br>
**Output:** -1

**Explanation:**
The sum of digits of x is 5. 23 is not divisible by 5. So 23 is not a Harshad number and the answer is -1.

 

**Constraints:**

- ``1 <= x <= 100``
