[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-04-02)

Given two strings ``s`` and ``t``, determine *if they are __isomorphic__*.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in ``s`` can be replaced to get ``t``.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "egg", t = "add" <br>
**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "foo", t = "bar" <br>
**Output:** false

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "paper", t = "title" <br>
**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

- ``1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104``

- ``t.length == s.length``

- ``s and t consist of any valid ascii character.``
