[Leetcode Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/apple-redistribution-into-boxes/solutions/4853764/simple-easy-to-understand-sorting-java-solution/)


You are given an array ``apple`` of size ``n`` and an array``capacity`` of size ``m``.

There are ``n`` packs where the ``ith`` pack contains ``apple[i]`` apples. There are m boxes as well, and the ith box has a capacity of ``capacity[i]`` apples.

Return *the __minimum number__ of boxes you need to select to redistribute these n packs of apples into boxes.*

__Note__ that, apples from the same pack can be distributed into different boxes.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** apple = [1,3,2], capacity = [4,3,1,5,2] <br>
**Output:** 2 <br>
**Explanation:** We will use boxes with capacities 4 and 5.
It is possible to distribute the apples as the total capacity is greater than or equal to the total number of apples.


**Example 2:**

**Input:** apple = [5,5,5], capacity = [2,4,2,7] <br>
**Output:** 4 <br>
**Explanation:** We will need to use all the boxes.
 

**Constraints:**

- ``1 <= n == apple.length <= 50``

- ``1 <= m == capacity.length <= 50``

- ``1 <= apple[i], capacity[i] <= 50`` 

- ``The input is generated such that it's possible to redistribute packs of apples into boxes.``
