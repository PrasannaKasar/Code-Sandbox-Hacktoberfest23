Merge Sorted Array Problem

Introduction

The "Merge Sorted Array" problem is a classic algorithmic challenge that is often featured in coding interviews and competitions. This problem is part of the LeetCode's collection of algorithmic challenges and is particularly useful for understanding array manipulation and two-pointer techniques.

Problem Statement

Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2 , merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array. The number of elements initialized in nums1 and nums2 are m and n respectively. You may assume that nums1 has a size equal to m + n such that it has enough space to hold additional elements from nums2.

Example
Input:

nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
