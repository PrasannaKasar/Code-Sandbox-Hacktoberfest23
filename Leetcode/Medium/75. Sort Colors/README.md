[Leetcode Soution]()

Given an array ``nums`` with n objects colored ``red``, ``white``, or ``blue``, sort them __in-place__ so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers ``0, 1, and 2`` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0] <br>
**Output:** [0,0,1,1,2,2]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,0,1] <br>
**Output:** [0,1,2]

**Constraints:**

n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 300
nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.
