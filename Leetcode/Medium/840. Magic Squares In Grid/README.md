[Leetcode Solution](https://onecompiler.com/java/42nnmuybk)

A 3 x 3 ``magic square`` is a 3 x 3 grid filled with distinct numbers from ``1 to 9`` such that each row, column, and both diagonals all have the same sum.

Given a ``row x col`` grid of integers, how many 3 x 3 contiguous magic square subgrids are there?

__Note__: while a magic square can only contain numbers from 1 to 9, grid may contain numbers up to 15.

 


**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[4,3,8,4],[9,5,1,9],[2,7,6,2]] <br>
**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** 

The following subgrid is a 3 x 3 magic square:

In total, there is only one magic square inside the given grid.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[8]] <br>
**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

- ``row == grid.length``

- ``col == grid[i].length``

- ``1 <= row, col <= 10``

- ``0 <= grid[i][j] <= 15``
