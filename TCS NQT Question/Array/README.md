Solution
Disclaimer: Donâ€™t jump directly to the solution, try it out yourself first.

Solution1: Sorting

Intuition: We can sort the array in ascending order, hence the smallest element will be at the 0th index. 

Approach: 

Sort the array in ascending order.
Print the 0th index.
DryRun: 

Before sorting: arr[] = {2,5,1,3,0};

After sorting: arr[] = {0,1,2,3,5};

Hence answer : arr[0] = 0
